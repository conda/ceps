## Abstract

The `.conda` package format has been in use within the conda ecosystem for years and has a number of advantages over the `.tar.bz2` format. However, building both `.conda` and `.tar.bz2` packages still requires multiple steps and is not well documented. conda-build should fully support building and outputting `.conda` package formats in addition to the "legacy" `.tar.bz2` format either individually or at the same time.

## Specification

Today, conda-build includes functionality to create `.conda` packages if:

- in a package's meta.yaml, output `type` field set to `conda_v2` *OR*
- in .condarc, `pkg_format` is set to 2

The proposal is to:

- Expand the `pkg_format` setting in the .condarc to accept a list of formats to build.
- Expand the conda_build_config.yaml with a setting to provide package format(s) and accept a list of formats.
- Improve conda-build's documentation for the package format and how to create it

A topic for discussion is whether default behavior should changed at some point to build both `.tar.bz2` and `.conda`, and the appropriate timeline to do so. This could help improve adoption and support of the `.conda` format.
