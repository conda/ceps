## Abstract

This CEP proposes a standard attestation layout for the conda ecosystem.
This attestation layout is based on the [in-toto] framework
and will enable further integration with signing schemes like
[Sigstore].

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC2119][RFC2119] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

More specifically, violations of a MUST or MUST NOT rule MUST result in an error. Violations of the
rules specified by any of the other all-capital terms MAY result in a warning, at discretion of the
implementation.

## Definitions and Concepts

- An **attestation** is a machine-readable cryptographically signed statement.
  When an attestation's signature is verified against a trusted key, that
  verification provides integrity and authenticity guarantees about the
  attestation's subject. For example:

  - Alice is the maintainer of the `widgets` package.
  - Alice signs a machine readable statement equivalent to the following
      English sentence, producing her attestation:

      ```text
      > Alice published the `widgets` package at version v1.2.3 with
      > hash `sha256:abcd...` to the `conda-forge` channel.
      ````

  - Bob establishes trust in Alice's public key.
  - Bob can verify the attestation's signature against Alice's public key,
      giving him confidence that the statement is true.
  - Correspondingly, Bob can reject any statement for `widgets` that is not
      signed by Alice's public key.

- [in-toto] is a framework and standard for defining attestations.

  - Within in-toto, an attestation's statement is composed of a
      **subject** and a **predicate**. The subject is the resource
      (or resources) being attested to, and the predicate is
      an arbitrary collection of metadata about the subject.
      The predicate is identified by a **predicate type**,
      which defines the predicate's expected schema.

- [Sigstore] is a project that enables misuse-resistant software signing
  and verification via short-lived certificates and a tamper-evident log.
  Sigstore uses attestation frameworks like in-toto to provide
  transparency and misuse-resistance properties on top of the integrity
  and authenticity properties of attestations.

  One of Sigstore's major misuse-resistance contributions is
  the use of *ephemeral keys* for signing. Modifying the example above:

  - Instead of maintaining a long-lived signing key, Alice generates an
     *ephemeral key* and binds it to her *identity*
     ("`alice@trustme.example.com`").

     This binding is done via a certificate issued by [Fulcio], which verifies a
     *proof of possession* (such as from [OpenID Connect]) from Alice for her
     identity. The certificate issued by Fulcio is, in turn auditable via
     [RFC 6962] Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.

  - Alice signs her attestation with her ephemeral key, and distributes a
      "bundle" containing both her attestation and her signing certificate.

  - Instead of establishing trust with a long-lived key from Alice, Bob establishes
      trust in Alice's identity.

  - Bob can verify the attestation's signature against Alice's emphemeral key,
      which in turn can be verified as authentically Alice's via the Fulcio-
      issued certificate.

  With this flow, neither Alice nor Bob needs to maintain long-lived signing
  or verifying keyrings, in turn reducing the attacker surface for key
  compromise.

  Another key misuse-resistance contribution within Sigstore is *machine
  identities*. A machine identity behaves similarly to a human identity
  (Alice or Bob), but identifies a machine instead of a human. For example,
  `github.com/example/example/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v1.2.3`
  could be the machine identity of a GitHub Actions workflow that ran from
  `release.yml` within `example/example` against the `v1.2.3` tag.

## Motivation

The conda ecosystem contains metadata that answers the following questions,
in part or in full:

- *Who* (or *what*) published this package?
- *What* is the package's hash?
- *Where* was this package *published from*, and where *to*?
- *When* was this package published?

However, the authenticity of this metadata is not currently
**cryptographically verifiable**: the consuming party must either trust it as
presented, or verify it manually against independent sources of truth (such as
a project's release history).

Attestations that present this metadata in a cryptographically
verifiable manner are desirable for a number of reasons:

- Package maintainers wish to demonstrate the integrity and authenticity
  of their package uploads;
- Individual downstream users wish to verify the integrity and authenticity of
  packages they consume, without placing additional trust in the
  channel or channel's hosting server;
- Attestations change the sophistication and risk profile for attackers in
  defenders' favor: the attacker must be sufficiently sophisticated
  to access private key material, *and* have a risk tolerance profile that
  accepts exposure via auditable transparency logs.

More broadly, attestation schemes like the one proposed in this CEP have
seen adoption in similar and related ecosystems:

- Python (PyPA/PyPI): [PEP 740] and [PyPI - Attestations]
- NodeJS (npm): [npm - Generating provenance statements]
- Ruby (RubyGems): [rubygems/release-gem]

## Specification

### Attestation format

This CEP proposes the following attestation statement layout, using the
[in-toto Statement schema]:

- `predicateType` **MUST** be `https://schemas.conda.org/attestations-publish-1.schema.json`
- `subject` **MUST** be a single [`ResourceDescriptor`], with the following
  constraints:
  - `subject[0].name` **MUST** be the full filename of the conda package
      that will be part of the `repodata.json` and under which it will appear on
      the server.
  - `subject[0].digest` **MUST** be a [`DigestSet`], and it **MUST** contain
      a single `sha256` entry with the SHA256 hash of the conda package.
- `predicate` **MAY** be present. If present and not `null`, it **MUST** be a
  JSON object with the following fields:
  - `targetChannel` **MUST** be a string, indicating where the package
      is being uploaded to. This field **MUST** be a valid URL with no
      trailing slashes.

An example of a compliant statement is provided below:

```json
{
    "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1",
    "subject": [{
        "name": "file-name-0.0.1-h123456_5.conda",
        "digest": {"sha256": "01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b"},

### Signing and distributing

This CEP recommends the following signing process:

1. The signer (i.e. Alice or Alice's trusted machine identity) uses a
   [Sigstore]-compatible client to generate an ephemeral keypair and bind it to
   their identity via a public certificate.
2. The signer generates an in-toto statement as described above, and
   produces an attestation by signing that statement with their ephemeral
   private key.
3. The signer uploads their attestation to the Sigstore transparency log
   (the [Public Good Instance]) as a [DSSE] envelope.
4. The signer produces a [Sigstore bundle] containing their certificate,
   attestation, and transparency log inclusion proof.

Each of these steps is performed transparently by a Sigstore client like
[sigstore-python], except for the generation of the in-toto statement in
step (2), which should be handled externally and then fed into the Sigstore
client for signing.

The result of this process is a single Sigstore bundle, which can be
distributed alongside the conda package or otherwise made discoverable.

This CEP does not define a distribution mechanism; see
[Future work](#future-work).

### Verifying

This CEP recommends the following verification process:

1. The verifier retrieves Alice's conda package and associated
   Sigstore bundle.
1. The verifier performs a standard Sigstore verification process against
   the bundle, using Alice's identity (or machine identity) as the
   signing identity. This process produces a verified in-toto statement.

   This step requires the verifier to establish trust in the identity
   being verified against.

   Exact mechanisms for establishing this trust are
   outside the scope of this CEP; see [Future work](#future-work).

1. The verifier checks the in-toto statement for consistency against their
   ground truth:

   - The `predicateType` field **MUST** be `https://schemas.conda.org/attestations-publish-1.schema.json`.
   - The `subject[0].name` field **MUST** match the filename of the conda package.
   - The `subject[0].digest` field **MUST** match the SHA256 hash of the conda
     package.
   - The `predicate.targetChannel` field **SHOULD** match the channel that
     the package was retrieved from, if `predicate` is present. However, the
     verifier **MAY** choose to allow a channel mismatch, e.g. if the known
     context is a mirroring context (where the conda package was originally
     published to a different channel, but is now being consumed from
     a mirror).

At the end of this process, the verifier is confident in the following facts:

- The package was published by the signer (Alice or Alice's machine identity).
  - If the publisher is a machine identity, this further establishes build
    provenance via the machine identity's claims. See [Sigstore OID information]
    for additional information on these claims.
- The integrity and authenticity of the package are guaranteed by the signer.

This CEP suggests that attestation verification be performed by
both clients (i.e. package installers retrieving packages from
attestation-aware channels) and servers (i.e. attestation-aware channels).

Servers **MUST** perform the same verification process as clients,
with the qualification that the server's trust in the signing identity
is established latently via the server's publishing and upload mechanism.
For example, if the server supports [Trusted Publishing], then the package's
attestation should be verified against the set of Trusted Publisher identities
for that package.

## Security Model

This section provides a high-level security model for the scheme proposed
in this CEP.

### Unforgeability of provenance

Traditional package distribution schemes depend on untrusted metadata
for provenance: the package itself describes its source repository,
its maintainers, etc.

This allows an attacker to forge a package's metadata such that a typical
downstream unduly trusts the package. For example, a typical downstream
may observe that the package lists a "trustworthy" GitHub repository
or organization as its source, and therefore trust the package without
confirming that its contents actually reflect those of the repository.
This is compounded when the *distribution format* (such as a conda package
or Python wheel) does not directly match the source layout (such as the
contents of a GitHub repository), making direct comparison nontrivial.

This CEP's design introduces an *unforgeability* property: a package
that claims a piece of untrusted metadata can be verified by cross-checking
that metadata against the package's attestation.

An attacker cannot forge or spoof this check, modulo their ability
to compromise the authentic signing identity itself.

### Transparency and auditability

Traditional signing schemes provide integrity and authenticity
modulo trust in a signing identity.

This is a strong property, but not a perfect one: an attacker who *does* manage
to compromise a signing identity can mount a *targeted* attack, wherein
the general public observes only legitimate artifacts and signatures while
the victim receives a malicious artifact with a valid signature from the
compromised signing identity. In effect, this makes it possible for the
attacker to maintain their stealth during a *targeted* attack, since
*untargeted* parties are not made aware of the malicious artifact or
its signature.

This CEP's design introduces a *transparency* property: attestations
are not considered valid unless they are included in a publicly
auditable, append-only transparency log. This log is made up of *entries*,
which bind over the attestation itself (including the subject),
the attestation's signature, as well as the attestation's signing identity.

Because a valid transparency log inclusion proof is a requirement during
verification, an attacker who compromises a signing identity *cannot*
perform a targeted attack without making the attack itself publicly
discoverable. This means the log can be monitored in real time for
uses of identities, allowing users to proactively detect and respond
to an identity being compromised, rather than having to wait for the
compromise being detected downstream and reported.

### Pre-established trust in signing identities

Like other signing schemes, this CEP's design does *not* eliminate
the need for trust establishment: a verifier who blindly accepts
attestations from any signing identity is effectively only protected
against opportunistic network-side attackers.

## Discussion

This predicate adds basic verifiable facts about the package. It will tie the
producer of the package to the target channel, if the attestation's producer
chooses to do so. A verifier can then use this information during the
verification process, checking that the target channel matches the channel the
package was retrieved from, or ignoring a mismatch between channels when the
package is retrieved from a mirror.

This is similar to what PyPI has implemented with the
[PyPI publish attestation]. Since there is no single authoritative index in
the conda world, we add the `targetChannel` field to reach parity.

## Future work

This CEP leaves three aspects of a complete attestation scheme open for
future discussion and work:

1. This CEP does not specify a mechanism for establishing trust in each
   conda package's signing identities. This is a non-trivial problem
   analogous to the key distribution problem in traditional PKI systems,
   albeit without the complications and operational challenges associated
   with long-lived key material.

    One potential mechanism for identity trust distribution is a TOFU (trust on
    first use) scheme with an attestation-aware conda channel, where package
    names are "locked" to attesting identities on first use, with subsequent
    updates being verified against that identity. This scheme requires a
    suitable lockfile format; [PEP 751] and its
    `[[package.attestation-identities]]` table may serve as prior art
    for a similar approach in the conda ecosystem.

2. This CEP does not specify a distribution mechanism for attestations
   (i.e., Sigstore bundles containing attestations).

    One potential distribution mechanism is to have attestation-aware
    conda channels distribute each package's attestations alongside
    the package, or via a similarly discoverable channel-side data.
    Prior art for this type of distribution mechanism can be found in
    the PyPI and RubyGems ecosystems, e.g. [PyPI's Integrity API].

3. This CEP specifies an single initial in-toto predicate
   (`https://schemas.conda.org/attestations-publish-1.schema.json`), which conveys
   a binding between a signing identity and its intent to publish
   a particular conda package to a particular channel.

   Future iterations of conda's attestation design may wish to support
   and use other predicate types, such as the [SLSA Provenance]
   (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) layout. Doing so
   would expose additional metadata about the package's source and build
   provenance, giving conda package consumers greater control over
   their consumption and admission policies.
