## Abstract

`menuinst` is a library used by `conda` to install menu items that point to commands provided by
`conda` packages. It operates by discovering certain JSON files located in `$PREFIX/Menu` after
linking the package to the environment.

This library has supported Windows for a long time but support for Linux and MacOS was not there
(even if the original project did offer support). As these platforms are brought up to speed, we
have an opportunity to fix some existing issues with the project and its integations. Namely:

1. Providing the same Python API for all platforms
2. Consolidating the `conda-standalone` / `constructor` CLI integrations in `conda` itself
3. Consolidating the JSON metadata required in each OS and formalize it in a schema so other
   implementations can validate it with automated tooling.


## Python API

### Current state

`menuinst` provides a Python API comprised of a single function `menuinst.install(...)`
with the following signature:

```python
def install(path, remove=False, prefix=sys.prefix, recursing=False, root_prefix=sys.prefix):
  ...
```

> Note that calling `menuinst.install` for platforms other than Windows currently fails due to the
extra `root_prefix` argument added for `conda-standalone` compatibility.

Other projects provide a layer on top of `menuinst.install`:

* `constructor/nsis/_nsis.py` [introduces](https://github.com/conda/constructor/blob/master/constructor/nsis/_nsis.py#L107)
  `mk_menus` and `rm_menus`, which iterate `PREFIX/Menu` looking for suitable JSON files.

```python
def mk_menus(remove=False, prefix=None, pkg_names=None, root_prefix=None):
    ...

def rm_menus(prefix=None, root_prefix=None):
    ...
```

* `conda` [provides](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/33a142c16530fcdada6c377486f1c1a385738a96/conda/gateways/disk/create.py#L231-L248)
 `make_menu`, which actively excludes Linux / MacOS.

```python
def make_menu(prefix, file_path, remove=False):
    ...
```

### Motivation

The official API is confusing (install can also remove) and leaves opportunity for downstream to
create their own logic for basic functionality. `menuinst` should be the sole provider here.


### Suggested actions

`menuinst` needs to provide two functions: `install` and `remove`.

```python
def install(metadata: [str, dict], target_prefix: str = sys.prefix, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix) -> List[str]:
  ...

def remove(metadata: [str, dict], target_prefix: str = sys.prefix, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix) -> List[str]:
  ...
```

`metadata` can be either a path to a JSON file, a file handler or an already parsed object.
Regardless the source, the resulting metadata object needs to satisfy the metadata schema.
Both functions return a list of strings that point to the path of the menu items created or removed.

Additionally, an utility function for prefixes could provide:

```python
def install_all(prefix: str, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix, filter: callable = None) -> List[List[str]]:
  ...

def remove_all(prefix: str, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix, filter: callable = None) -> List[List[str]]:
  ...
```

It should be discussed whether:

* `root_prefix` is only used internally by `conda-standalone` / `constructor` and hence should be
  made a private name `_root_prefix`.
* `recursing` is needed on Windows or not.
* A list (of lists) of strings is the best way to return the created shortcuts. Some platforms
  create a directory with shortcuts (Windows), some create several directories (MacOS), some create
  a list of files in a given location (Linux).

### Backwards compatibility

New `conda` releases will pin accordingly. Releasing this API would entail a new major version, which
should be enough to prevent breakages. Current version `4.11` is
[pinning](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/meta.yaml#L46)
`menuinst` as `>=1.4.11,<2`.


## CLI API

### Current state

`menuinst` does provide a CLI through [`menuinst.main`](https://github.com/conda/menuinst/blob/9ae6c95/menuinst/main.py):

```console
$> menuinst [--remove] [--prefix=sys.prefix] [json_file json_file ...]
```

However, `constructor` needs a way to call it from `conda-standalone`, which prompted this project
to provide a [custom entry point](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-standalone-feedstock/blob/834590a/recipe/entry_point.py#L25-L88)
that mimics a `conda` sub-command:

```console
$> conda-standalone constructor [--prefix] [--make-menus|--rm-menus] ...
```

> This is needed because, even with `menuinst` own CLI, `conda-standalone` is a `pyinstaller`-frozen
> executable which cannot call arbitrary entry points in the bundle.

### Motivation

A standard `menuinst` CLI (standalone or through conda) is needed and must not be provided as part
of the `conda-standalone` project only. It is a surprising behaviour that needs to be replicated
by other implementations and, as such, should be part of the main codebase.

> `constructor` allows a different standalone conda executable to be bundled through the `--conda-exe`
option, which opens the possibility of using `micromamba` as the bundled conda. The `constructor`
sub-command is expected though, so `micromamba` needs to provide it as well.

### Suggested actions

Provide a `conda constructor` subcommand, officially part of the `conda` core. It should implement
the same CLI as currently found in the `constructor` entry point, delegating the menu creation
and removal to the `menuinst` public API. This CLI should be standardized so other projects can
implement it if needed.

`menuinst` itself does not need to provide a CLI, but if it does, it should be as similar as possible
to the `constructor` counterparts.

Alternatively, add support in conda-standalone for `conda run`, so one can call arbitrary code
within the frozen binary. This would allow us to place scripts and executables inside conda-standalone
without having to patch the entry point:

```console
$> conda-standalone run python -m menuinst ...
$> conda-standalone run python -m constructor_helper ...
```

## Menu metadata schema

### Current state

The required metadata for each platform is documented in [the `menuinst` wiki](https://github.com/conda/menuinst/wiki/Menu-Shortcut-Config-Structure/632fbc84251c8a8093e1b56b0b5314d23c1e946b).
However, only Windows is really supported by the tool. This assymmetrical growth has allowed Windows
to grow an ad-hoc specification that doesn't really translate well to other platforms.

The overall schema seems to be:

```python
{
  "menu_name": str,
  "menu_items": list of dict,
}
```

Unfortunately, each menu item dict (let's call it `MenuItem`) takes a different form in each platform.

#### `MenuItem` on Windows

```python
{
  ["system" | "script" | "pyscript" | "pywscript" | "webbrowser"]: str,
  "scriptargument": str,
  "scriptarguments": list of str,
  "name": str,
  "workdir": str,
  "icon": str,
  "desktop": bool,
  "quicklaunch": bool,
}
```

Currently allowed placeholders are:

* `${PREFIX}`: Python environment prefix
* `${ROOT_PREFIX}`: Python environment prefix of root (conda or otherwise) installation
* `${PYTHON_SCRIPTS}`: Scripts folder in Python environment, `${PREFIX}/Scripts`
* `${MENU_DIR}`: Folder for menu config and icon files, `${PREFIX}/Menu`
* `${PERSONALDIR}`: Not sure
* `${USERPROFILE}`: User's home folder
* `${ENV_NAME}`: The environment in which this shortcut lives.
* `${DISTRIBUTION_NAME}`: The name of the folder of the root prefix, for example "Miniconda" if
  distribution installed at "C:\Users\Miniconda".
* `${PY_VER}`: The Python major version only. This is taken from the root prefix. Used generally
  for placing shortcuts under a menu of a parent installation.
* `${PLATFORM}`: one of (32-bit) or (64-bit). This is taken from the root prefix. Used generally
  for placing shortcuts under a menu of a parent installation.

#### `MenuItem` on MacOS

```python
{
    "cmd": str
    "name": str,
    "icns": str,
}
```

Currently allowed placeholders are:

* `${BIN_DIR}`: `PREFIX/bin`
* `${MENU_DIR}`: `PREFIX/Menu`

#### `MenuItem` on Linux

```python
{
    "cmd": list of str,
    "id": str,
    "name": str,
    "comment": str.
    "terminal": bool,
    "icon": str,
},
```

On Linux, only `cmd` can take two special placeholders `{{FILEBROWSER}}` and `{{WEBBROWSER}}`, which are
replaced by the default Desktop file explorer, and the default web browser, respectively.


### Motivation

#### Standardize the `command` interface

Windows has several ways to specify which command should be run with the shortcut:

* `system` + `scriptargument[s]`: path to executable plus its arguments.
* `script` + `scriptargument[s]`: same as above, but the executable is run in a subprocess after
  invoking `ROOT_PYTHON cwp.py PREFIX`.
* `pyscript`: hardcodes `script` to be `PREFIX/python.exe` and takes the value as the first (and
  only) argument.
* `pywscript`: same as above, but uses `pythonw.exe` as the launcher to, theoretically, avoid
  launching a console window next to your application.
* `webbrowser`: alias to `PREFIX/python -m webbrowser -t URL`.

On Linux the command is specified with `cmd`, expressed as a list of strings. On MacOS, `cmd` is
also taken, but in this case it's expected to be a raw string.

#### Standardize the `icon` key

Windows and Linux expect `icon`. MacOS expects `icns`. Each platform requires a different file format,
but that can be arranged with placeholders.

#### Standardize the placeholders

Allowed placeholders vary vastly across platforms. A common subset must be identified and implemented.
Per-platform options are allowed but only when strictly necessary.

### Suggested actions

#### New validated schema

The current (unstandardized) schema will be considered version 1.0. The new schema will be versioned
with `$id`:

```python
{
  "$schema": str,
  "$id": str,
  "menu_name": str,
  "menu_items": [
    {
      "name": str,
      "description": str,
      "icon": str,
      "command": list of str,
      "working_dir": str,
      "activate": bool,
      "terminal": bool,
      "platform_options": {
        "windows": {
          "desktop": bool,
          "quicklaunch": bool,
        },
        "linux": {
          # Taken from the freedesktop.org standards
          "Categories": str or list of str,
          "DBusActivatable": bool,
          "GenericName": str,
          "Hidden": bool,
          "Implements": str or list of str,
          "Keywords": str or list of str,
          "MimeType": str or list of str,
          "NoDisplay": bool,
          "NotShowIn": str or list of str,
          "OnlyShowIn": str or list of str,
          "PrefersNonDefaultGPU": bool,
          "StartupNotify": bool,
          "StartupWMClass": str,
          "TryExec": str,
        },
        "osx": {
          # Properties taken from the info.plist standards
          "CFBundleDisplayName": str,
          "CFBundleIdentifier": str,
          "CFBundleName": str,
          "CFBundleSpokenName": str,
          "CFBundleVersion": str,
        },
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each JSON file will be validated against its `$id` schema during build time, as part of conda-build.

#### Allowed placeholders

Each platform must provide these placeholders, to be used in the value of any `str`-accepting key.
Note that a Jinja-like syntax is used now instead of the legacy shell-like syntax. This is done to
prevent assumptions on non-Unix platforms.

* `{{ BASE_PREFIX }}`: Path to the base (conda or otherwise) installation.
* `{{ DISTRIBUTION_NAME }}`: The name of the folder of the base prefix, for example "Miniconda" if
   distribution installed at `C:\Users\Miniconda` or `/usr/local/miniconda`.
* `{{ BASE_PYTHON }}`: Path to the Python interpreter found in the base installation.
* `{{ PREFIX }}`: Path to the environment where the shortcut metadata was found.
* `{{ ENV_NAME }}`: The environment name in which this shortcut comes from.
* `{{ PYTHON }}`: Path to the Python interpreter installed in PREFIX.
* `{{ MENU_DIR }}`: Folder for menu config and icon files, `{{ PREFIX }}/Menu`.
* `{{ BIN_DIR }}`: Folder for menu config and icon files, `{{ PREFIX }}/bin` on Unix;
  `{{ PREFIX }}\Library\bin` on Windows.
* `{{ SP_DIR }}`: `{{ PREFIX }}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` on Unix. `{{ PREFIX }}\Lib\site-packages` on
  Windows.
* `{{ PY_VER }}`: The Python major version only. This is taken from the root prefix.
* `{{ HOME }}`: Personal directory of the user.
* `{{ ICON_EXT }}`: `ico` on Windows, `png` on Linux, `icns` on MacOS.

Windows only:

* `{{ SCRIPTS_DIR }}`: Scripts folder in Python environment, `{{ PREFIX }}/Scripts`.
* `{{ PYTHONW }}`: Path to `pythonw.exe` in PREFIX.
* `{{ BASE_PYTHONW }}`: Path to `pythonw.exe` in BASE_PREFIX.

MacOS only:

* `{{ PYTHONAPP }}`: Path to `python.app` executable wrapper (if installed).


### Backwards compatibility

Windows users do depend on the existing schema. There are a lot of packages that use it. This
(unversioned) document needs to be kept around and respected. In the absence of the `$schema` key,
it will be assumed that the metadata is built with the legacy schema. This will be validated too,
but will only throw warnings to prevent badly formed documents from being used successfully.
