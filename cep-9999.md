## Abstract

Given a `$CONDA_PREFIX/conda-meta/frozen` marker file, tools will prevent modifications in
`$CONDA_PREFIX` unless a special override flag is passed.

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
  "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
  described in [RFC2119][RFC2119] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Motivation

This CEP is inspired by [PEP 668][PEP-668], which defines the `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker file for
Python virtual environments. The conda ecosystem could benefit from a similar file for conda
environments. Some examples include:

- Protecting modifications of the `base` environment in `conda` installations.
- Protecting external management of `.pixi/envs/*` environments by other tools.
- Reproducibility of the build and host environments in conda package building tools.


## Specification

- The marker file path MUST be `$CONDA_PREFIX/conda-meta/frozen`. This is case-sensitive.
- The marker file can be empty. It MAY contain a JSON document with schema `{"message": str}`. This is, an object with a single `message` key mapped to a non-empty string.
- Tools MUST respect the presence of `frozen` in the environment and error out with:
    - A message chosen by the tool, if `frozen` is empty.
    - The message included in the `message` key, if `frozen` is not empty.
    - A help message explaining how to override the check, if available.
- Tools SHOULD offer a way to override the presence of `frozen` (e.g. `--override-frozen-env`).
  However, tools MUST NOT offer ways to enable the overrides by default.

## Example

An example `frozen` file can be:

```json
{
    "message": "This environment is running a production service.\nIt is marked as read-only and MUST not be modified."
}
```

A hypothetical tool finding this file in the environment to be modified would output something
like the following and then exit:

```
Could not modify environment. The environment has been marked as frozen. Reason:

    This environment is running a production service.
    It is marked as read-only and MUST not be modified.

You can bypass this check by using the `--override-frozen-env-checks` flag, at your own risk.
```

## Rationale

The `conda-meta/` directory has been chosen as a target location for the marker file so
packages cannot dictate whether a conda environment is frozen or not. Such a state should
be governed by the initial state of the installation and user configuration choices. That
said, a package could still rely on post-link scripts to freeze a conda environment upon
installation.

This CEP only standardizes how conda ecosystem tools handle the presence of `conda-meta/frozen`
in conda environments. More specifically, it does not attempt to block how Python packaging
tools like `pip`, `uv` or `poetry` interact with a conda environment. If users want to really
protect their conda environment from Python packaging tools, they should also resort to
mechanisms like [PEP 668][PEP-668].
