## Abstract

This CEP aims to standardize names and other strings used throughout the conda ecosystem.

## Specification

### Package names

The conda ecosystem distinguishes between two types of package names:

- Regular package names: represented by a concrete, downloadable, extractable conda artifact.
- Virtual package names: not backed by any physical artifact. They only exist on the client side.

A regular package name MUST only consist of lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, hyphens, periods and underscores. It MUST start with a letter, a number, or a single underscore. It MUST NOT start with two consecutive underscores.

Virtual package names MUST only consist of lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, hyphens, periods and underscores. They MUST start with two underscores.

This means that regular package names are limited to those which match the following case-insensitive regex: `^(([a-z0-9])|([a-z0-9_](?!_)))[._-]?([a-z0-9]+(\.|-|_|$))*$`.

Virtual package names MUST follow this other regex: `^__([a-z0-9]+(\.|-|_|$))+$`.

### Channel and label names

Channel names MUST only consist of lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, hyphens, periods and underscores. They MUST start and end with a letter or a digit. In other words, they MUST match  this regex:  `^[a-z0-9]+((-|_|.)[a-z0-9]+)*$`.

Channel label names MUST only consist of ASCII letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, slashes, periods, colons and whitespace. They MUST start with a letter. They MUST match this regex: `^[a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_\-\.\/:\s]*`.

### Subdir names

Platform or subdir names MUST only consist of lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores and periods. They MUST start and end with a letter or a number. They MUST match this regex: `^[a-z0-9]+((-|_|.)[a-z0-9]+)*$`.

### Build strings

Builds strings MUST only consist of lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, and underscores. They MUST match this regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`
