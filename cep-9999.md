## Abstract

Have conda channels serve standalone `run_exports` metadata, next to `repodata.json`.

## Motivation

Building infrastructure (such as some conda-forge bots) use `run_exports` to calculate which packages need rebuilding as part of an upgrade. Right now, conda-forge needs to maintain their own JSON database, which involves downloading and extracting the new artifacts as they become available: the `run_exports` metadata lives inside the `.tar.bz2` and `.conda` files.

Since `conda-index` already processes the package metadata to generate `repodata.json`, it would be trivial to also generate `run_exports.json` and serve them together.

## Precedence and role in the pinning resolution process

This file is not meant to replace the `run_exports` metadata already present in the package archives. It merely presents that information in a more convenient way. 
`conda-build`-like clients are free to use either the `run_exports` metadata in the archives or the one in `run_exports.json`, since they MUST be equivalent.
Special keys like `pin_run_as_build` MUST keep their behavior, since `run_exports.json` does not add a new level of precedence in the pinning resolution process. Again, it's an equivalent source for information already present in the archives.

This means that `run_exports.json` MUST NOT be patched (like it is done with `repodata.json`);
it MUST always reflect the metadata present in the archives. 
If at some point this decision needs to be reverted, it will involve a change in the schema version to ensure backwards compatibility.

## Specification

The schema of `run_exports.json` will mimic the `repodata.json` structure whenever possible:

* `info`: metadata about the platform, architecture, and version of the `run_exports.json` schema.
* `packages`: map of `.tar.bz2` filenames to `run_exports` metadata `dict`.
* `packages.conda`: map of `.conda` filenames to `run_exports` metadata `dict`.

Each `run_exports` metadata `dict` can contain the following fields; each field accepts a list of strings (conda-build specs).

- `weak`
- `strong`
- `weak_constrains`
- `strong_constrains`
- `noarch`

```json
{   
    "info": {
        "platform": "string",
        "arch": "string",
        "subdir": "string",
        "version": 0
    },
    "packages": {
        "package-version-build.tar.bz2": {
            "run_exports": {
                "noarch": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
            }
        }
    },
    "packages.conda": {
        "package-version-build.conda": {
            "run_exports": {
                "noarch": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If a package does not define `run_exports`, the corresponding entry in `packages` or `packages.conda` MUST be an empty `run_exports` item:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "platform": "string",
        "arch": "string",
        "subdir": "string",
        "version": 0
    },
    "packages": {
        "package-version-build.tar.bz2": {
            "run_exports": {}
        }
    },
    "packages.conda": {
        "package-version-build.conda": {
            "run_exports": {}
        }
    }
}
```

## Backwards compatibility

This is a new feature, so there is no backwards compatibility to worry about.

## Alternatives

We could maintain the status quo and ask downstream infrastructure to maintain their own database. However, this is a burden on them, and it is trivial to generate this data.

We also considered _adding_ the `run_exports` metadata to `repodata.json`, but this has a few shortcomings:

- It would require extending the `repodata` schema, currently not formally standardized.
- It would increase the size of the already heavy `repodata.json` files.
- (Typed) repodata parsers would need to be updated to handle the new field.

Finally, we studied whether the `run_exports` metadata already present in the `channeldata.json` metadata would be enough. However, this metadata is only presented per version (not build), so it is insufficient and incomplete.

## FAQ

### Which packages should be included?

All packages present in the unpatched `repodata.json` (`repodata_from_packages.json` in some channels) documents should be included.

### Will this affect the performance of repodata fetching?

Only package building infrastructure (such as conda-forge bots) will need to fetch this data. The rest of the ecosystem (such as CLI conda clients) will not be affected.
