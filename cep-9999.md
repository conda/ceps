## Abstract

This CEP describes a release cadence for all future `conda-build` versions starting with `23.3.0`.

## Specification

We propose regularly scheduled bi-annual (every six months) releases where the tagging/release occurs during the week (per ISO 8601, Monday through Thursday) of the **third** Monday of the month (i.e., a week after the `conda` release of the same month).

In adopting this release schedule we will also conform to the Deprecation Policy defined in [CEP-9][cep9].

To accomplish better, more predictable versioning, we will adopt [CalVer][calver]:
- `YY`: the major version will be the shortened year (22+)
- `MM`: the minor version will be the shortened month (1-12)
- `MICRO`: the micro/patch version is reset to zero every month and incremented for every additional release that occurs during that month (0+)

This scheme will start with the March 2023 release of 23.3.0, resulting in the following regular release schedule:

| Version | Release Week |
|---|---|
| 23.3.0 | 2022-09-12 |
| 23.9.0 | 2022-11-14 |
| 24.3.0 | 2023-01-09 |
| 24.9.0 | 2023-03-13 |
| ... | ... |

> **Note**
> Despite following a bi-annual release schedule, we will permit releases to occur at any time between regular releases for hotfixes, security releases, or other high-priority changes that require immediate release.

To distinguish between the bi-annual release schedule and other optional releases, we define the following release types:

- **Regular release**: the regularly scheduled bi-annual release
- **Optional release**: releases that may occur on alternating months from regular releases
- **Hotfix release**: extra releases that may occur during any month to patch an earlier release of the same month (whether a regular or optional release)

So, it's entirely feasible to see the following releases:

| Version | Release Type |
|---|---|
| 23.9.0 | regular |
| 23.9.1 | hotfix |
| 23.9.2 | hotfix |
| 23.10.0 | optional |
| 23.10.1 | hotfix |
| 23.12.0 | optional |
| 23.12.1 | hotfix |
| ... | ... |

> **Note**
> In case no or few significant changes have been made since the last release, the conda-build maintainer team may decide to skip a regular release, as long as the decision is made public and documented in the changelog.

## Motivation

Our goal with this CEP is to remove ambiguity/maintainer guesswork of when and what warrants a release and to also provide a means by which we can adopt the Deprecation Policy ([CEP-9][cep9]) for conda-build.

## Backwards Compatibility

Adopting this release schedule does not break any existing processes or schemes.

Since `SemVer` is semantically interchangeable with `CalVer` and we propose switching from `conda-build 3.23.3` to `conda-build 23.3.0`, both version parsing and version ordering will be unaffected.

## Alternatives

1. Do nothing. Continue with ad hoc releases.
    - Rejected for being too inconsistent and challenging for roadmap/planning/deprecation purposes.
2. Follow Conda Release Schedule ([CEP-8][cep8]).
    - Rejected for being too fast given the current pace of development.

## Resolution

TBD
