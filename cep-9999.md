## Abstract

There should be a way to test out potential new features that are being developed for conda as a way to take advantage of new developments and to gather real world feedback on a feature in order to understand if its useful, practical, and stable.

This is similiar to many other products having an opt in beta, feature flags toggle, etc. This would be a housing mechanism for all the potential experimental features/changes that are developed and enable a single point that users could understand what is available as well as enable any particular experiment. Will also authors of such experiments to make what they are doing more visible.
