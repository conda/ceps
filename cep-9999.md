## Abstract

This CEP describes version strings as used in the conda ecosystem, and their ordering.

## Motivation

The motivation of this CEP is mostly informative, but will also try to clarify some ambiguous details that should be homogenized across existing implementations.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC2119][RFC2119] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

More specifically, violations of a MUST or MUST NOT rule MUST result in an error. Violations of the
rules specified by any of the other all-capital terms MAY result in a warning, at discretion of the
implementation.

### Version strings

[CEP 26](./cep-0026.md) only discussed the type of characters that can be part of a version string, and its maximum length:

> [...] version strings MUST only consist of digits, periods, lowercase ASCII letters, underscores, plus symbols, and exclamation marks. The maximum length of a version string MUST NOT exceed 64 characters.

The present CEP _extends_ this rules with additional constraints:

- Version strings MUST be composed of alphanumeric characters `[A-Za-z0-9]`, separated into segments by periods `.` and underscores `_`.
- The first segment MUST start with a digit.
- Empty segments (i.e. two consecutive dots, a leading/trailing underscore) MUST NOT be allowed.
- All segments SHOULD start with a digit for clarity.
- A single epoch number (a positive integer followed by `!`) MAY prefix the rest of the string.
- A single local version string MAY be added at the end, separated by a plus symbol `+`.

### Ordering

Before being compared, version strings MUST be parsed into a list of segments (with each segment being a list of components) as follows:

- They are first split into _epoch_, _main version_, and _local version_ at `!` and `+` respectively.
  - If there is no `!`, the epoch is set to `0`.
  - If there is no `+`, the local version is empty.
- The main version part is then split into components at `.` and `_`.
  - Each component is split again into consecutive runs of numerals and non-numerals.
  - Subcomponents containing only numerals are converted to integers.
  - Strings are converted to lowercase, with special treatment for `dev` and `post`.
  - When a component starts with a letter, the fill value `0` is inserted.
- The epoch and main version segments are concatenated.
- The same is repeated for the local version part, and stored as a separate list of segments.

For example:

```python
>>> parse("1.2g.beta15.rc")
[[0], [1], [2, 'g'], [0, 'beta', 15], [0, 'rc']], []
>>> parse("1!2.15.1_ALPHA")
[[1], [2], [15], [1, 'alpha']], []
>>> parse("1!2.15.1_alpha+1.2.3h123")
[[1], [2], [15], [1], [0, 'alpha']], [[1], [2], [3, 'h', 123]]
```

The resulting list of components MUST be compared as follows:

- Integers are compared numerically.
- Strings are compared lexicographically, case-insensitive. The substring `dev` is always smaller.
- Strings are considered smaller than integers, except for `post`, which is always greater.
- When a component has no correspondent, the missing component is assumed to be `0`.
- Local versions are only compared when the main versions are identical.

> Warning:
> Pre-releases markers are sensitive to leading zeros and periods. While `"1.1.0" == "1.1.0.0" ==
> "1.1"`, the rule "When a component starts with a letter, the fill value `0` is inserted" results
> in `"1.1.0rc" == "1.1.rc" > "1.1rc"`. See [conda#12568](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/12568).

## Rationale

- The first segment of a version must start with a digit to avoid confusing situations like `v13.2.1` being smaller than `3.1.0`.
- The `dev` substring is handled differently to allow `dev` pre-releases to sort before alphas, betas and release candidates.
- The `post` substring is handled differently to allow `post` releases to sort after any equivalent final release.
- Missing components are treated like `0` to allow equivalences like `'1.1' == '1.1.0'`.
- The `0` fill value is used in components starting with letters to keep numbers and strings in phase, resulting in `'1.1.a1' == '1.1.0a1'`.

## Backwards compatibility

This CEP _extends_ [CEP 26](./cep-0026.md) with more details about version strings.

`conda` has historically allowed versions to start with a non-numeric character. This is now forbidden to avoid issues like `v10.4.5` being interpreted as smaller than `3.3.2`.

## Examples

The ordering specification results in the following versions sorted in this way:

```sh
   0.4
== 0.4.0
<  0.4.1.rc
== 0.4.1.RC   # case-insensitive comparison
<  0.4.1
<  0.5a1
<  0.5b3
<  0.5C1      # case-insensitive comparison
<  0.5
<  0.9.6
<  0.960923
<  1.0
<  1.1dev1    # special case ``dev``
<  1.1a1
<  1.1.0dev1  # special case ``dev``
== 1.1.dev1   # 0 is inserted before string
<  1.1.a1
<  1.1.0rc1
<  1.1.0
== 1.1.0.0
== 1.1
<  1.1.0post1 # special case ``post``
== 1.1.post1  # 0 is inserted before string
<  1.1post1   # special case ``post``
<  1996.07.12
<  1!0.4.1    # epoch increased
<  1!3.1.1.6
<  2!0.4.1    # epoch increased again
```

Local versions are not very common but there are some examples:

$ conda search "*[version='*+*']"
