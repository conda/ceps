## Abstract

This CEP standardizes the grammar for the `MatchSpec` query language.

## Motivation

The motivation of this CEP is merely informative. It describes the details of an existing grammar.

## Nomenclature

The `MatchSpec` query syntax is a mini-language designed to query package records from one or more conda channels. It is sometimes referred to as simply _spec_.

## Mini language

The `MatchSpec` mini language has gone through several iterations:

- Positional syntax, with two variants: space- and `=`-separated.
- Square brackets syntax.

### Space-separated positional syntax

The simplest form merely consists of up to six positional arguments: `[channel[/subdir]:[namespace]:]name [version [build]]`. Only `name` is required. `version` can be any version specifier. `build` can be any string matcher. See "Match conventions" below.

### `=`-separated positional syntax

The positional syntax also allows the `=` character as a separator, instead of a space, between `name`, `version` and `build`. When this is the case, versions are interpreted differently. `pkg=1.8` will be taken as `1.8.*` (fuzzy), but `pkg 1.8` will give `1.8` (exact). To have fuzzy matches with the space syntax, you need to use `pkg =1.8`. This nuance does not apply if a `build` string is present; both `foo==1.0=*` and `foo=1.0=*` are equivalent (they both understand the version as `1.0`, exact).

### Square brackets syntax

`MatchSpec` queries can be also specified with keyword arguments between square brackets. Key-value pairs can be delimited by comma, space, or comma+space. Value can optionally be wrapped in single or double quotes, but must be wrapped if `value` contains a comma, space, or equal sign. Their values can be quoted with single or double quotes. The accepted keys are:

- `channel` (`str`): Name or URL of a channel
- `subdir` (`str`): Identifier of the subdir (either platform-specific or `noarch`)
- `version` (`str`): A version specifier
- `build` (`str`): Build string or a glob match.
- `build_number` (`int`): Number of the build
- `md5` (`str`): MD5 hash of the artifact
- `sha256` (`str`): SHA256 hash of the artifact

These are also accepted but have reduced utility beyond local or remote searches:

- `url`
- `track_features`
- `features`
- `license`
- `license_family`
- `fn`

When both positional and keyword arguments are used, the keyword arguments override the positional information, except for `name` (positional value wins).

## Canonical representation

Since there are several ways of specifying the same information, a canonical representation is welcome. The currently accepted notation is:

```text
(channel(/subdir):(namespace):)name(version(build))[key1='value 1',key2=value2]
```

where `()` indicate optional fields. `version` and `build` can be separated by a
space or `=` (see above). The rules for constructing a canonical string
representation are:

1. `name` (i.e. "package name") is required, but its value can be `*`. Its position is always
   outside the key-value brackets.
2. If `version` is an exact version, it goes outside the key-value brackets and is prepended
   by `==`. If `version` is a "fuzzy" value (e.g. `1.11.*`), it goes outside the key-value
   brackets with the `.*` left off and is prepended by `=`. Otherwise `version` is included
   inside key-value brackets.
3. If `version` is an exact version, and `build` is an exact value, `build` goes outside
   key-value brackets prepended by a `=`. Otherwise, `build` goes inside key-value brackets.
   `build_string` is an alias for `build`.
4. The `namespace` position is being held for a future conda feature.
5. If `channel` is included and is an exact value, a `::` separator is used between `channel`
   and `name`. `channel` can either be a canonical channel name or a channel url. In the
   canonical string representation, the canonical channel name will always be used.
6. If `channel` is an exact value and `subdir` is an exact value, `subdir` is appended to
   `channel` with a `/` separator. Otherwise, `subdir` is included in the key-value brackets.
7. The canonical format for key-value pairs uses comma delimiters and single quotes.
8. When constructing a `MatchSpec` queries instance from a string, any key-value pair given
   inside the key-value brackets overrides any matching parameter given outside the brackets.

## Match conventions

Since the only required field is `name`, any non-specified field is the equivalent of a full wildcard match (`*`).

### String matching

When `MatchSpec` queries attribute values are simple strings, they are interpreted using the
following conventions:

- If the string begins with `^` and ends with `$`, it is converted to a regex.
- If the string contains an asterisk (`*`), it is transformed from a glob to a regex. For example, `*cuda` becomes `^.*cuda$`.
- Otherwise, an exact match to the string is sought.

### Version specifiers

Version strings and their ordering are being standardized in https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/132. With that ordering in mind, the following operators are allowed:

- Range operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. Note that `<1.0` would include `1.0a` given the ordering above!
- Exact equality and negated equality: `==`, `!=`.
- Fuzzy equality: `=`, `*`. `=1.0` and `1.0.*` are equivalent, and both would match `1.0.0` and `1.0.1`, but not `1.1` or `0.9`.
- Logical operators: `|` means OR, `,` means AND. `1.0|1.2` would match both `1.0` and `1.2`. `>=1.0,<2.0a0` would match everything between `1.0` and the last version before `2.0a0`. `,` (AND) has higher precedence than `|` (OR). `>=1,<2|>3` means `(>=1,<2)|(>3)`; i.e. greater than or equal to `1` AND less than `2` or greater than `3`, which matches `1`, `1.3` and `3.0`, but not `2.2`.
- Semver-like operator: `~=`. `~=0.5.3` is equivalent to `>=0.5.3,0.5.*` and this syntax is preferred for backwards compatibility.

No spaces are allowed between operators. `1.8*` and `1.8.*` are equivalent, but the latter is preferred for clarity. Mixing `*` with range, semver, inequality, fuzzy equality or exact equality operators SHOULD NOT be allowed.

### Exact matches

To fully-specify a package record with a full, exact spec, these fields must be given as exact values: `channel` (preferably by URL), `subdir`, `name`, `version`, `build`. Alternatively, an exact spec can also be given by `*[md5=12345678901234567890123456789012]` or `*[sha256=f453db4ffe2271ec492a2913af4e61d4a6c118201f07de757df0eff769b65d2e]`.

## Examples

```python
>>> str(MatchSpec('foo 1.0 py27_0'))
'foo==1.0=py27_0'
>>> str(MatchSpec('foo=1.0=py27_0'))
'foo==1.0=py27_0'
>>> str(MatchSpec('conda-forge::foo[version=1.0.*]'))
'conda-forge::foo=1.0'
>>> str(MatchSpec('conda-forge/linux-64::foo>=1.0'))
"conda-forge/linux-64::foo[version='>=1.0']"
>>> str(MatchSpec('*/linux-64::foo>=1.0'))
"foo[subdir=linux-64,version='>=1.0']"
```

## Rationale

- Mixing `*` with other operators is disallowed as per the recommendations discussed in https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/60.
