## Abstract

This CEP standardizes the syntax for the `MatchSpec` query language.

## Motivation

The motivation of this CEP is merely informative. It describes the details of an existing DSL.

## Nomenclature

The `MatchSpec` query syntax is a mini-language designed to query package records from one or more conda channels. It is sometimes referred to as simply _spec_ or _conda spec_.

## Specification

`MatchSpec` strings provide a compact method to query collections of conda artifacts (e.g. in a conda channel, or in an installed environment) by matching `str` and `int` fields on package records (see [CEP PR #133's `./info/index.json`](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/133) and [CEP PR#135's "Package Record Metadata"](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/135)).

The most commonly queried fields are `name`, `version`, `build` and `channel`.

### Syntax

The `MatchSpec` syntax can be thought of as a structured collection of _matching expressions_, each targeting a package record field. A matching expression is defined as a string that MUST follow these rules:

- For expressions targeting the `version` field, [version specifier rules](#version-matching) MUST be applied.
- For expressions targeting any other `str` field, [string matching conventions](#string-matching) MUST be used.
- For expressions targeting `int` fields, the target value MUST be converted to `str` and handled as such.

The full `MatchSpec` syntax takes this approximate form, with parentheses denoting optional fields:

```text
(channel(/subdir):(namespace):)name(version(build))([key1='value 1',key2=value2])
```

More precisely, the following rules apply:

- A `MatchSpec` string MAY exhibit two forms of expressions: positional and keyword based.
- Six positional expressions are recognized. From left to right, they can be are arranged in two groups: (`channel`, `subdir` and `namespace`) and (`name`, `version`, `build`).
  - The first group is optional. If present, it MUST be separated from the second one by a single colon character `:`. Within this group, there are four items:
    - `channel: str`. Optional
    - `subdir: str`. Optional. It requires `channel` to be defined. Must be separated from `channel` by a single forward slash, `/`.
    - A colon `:` separator, required if `channel` or `namespace` are defined.
    - `namespace: str`. Optional. This expression field MUST be parsed and ignored.
  - The second group contains three expressions. They MUST be separated by either spaces or a single `=` character. Separator types MUST NOT be mixed. See the [version expression parsing notes](#version-expression-parsing) for additional details on the interaction between the `=` symbol as a separator and as an operator.
    - `name: str`. Required.
    - `version: str | VersionSpec`. Optional.
    - `build: str`. Optional. It requires `version` to be present.
- All keyword expressions are optional. If present, they MUST be enclosed in a single set of square brackets, after the positional expressions. The following rules apply:
  - Keyword expressions are written as key-value pairs. They MUST be built by joining the name of the target field (key) and the expression string (value) with a single `=` character. The expression string MUST be quoted with single `'` or double `"` quotes if it contains spaces.
  - Target-expression pairs MUST be separated by a single comma character `,`.
  - Spaces between separators MAY be allowed and MUST be ignored.
- When both positional and keyword expressions are used, the keyword expressions override the positional values, except for `name` (its positional value MUST always win).

### Canonical representation

Since there are several ways of specifying the same information, a canonical representation is welcome. The currently accepted notation is:

```text
(channel(/subdir):(namespace):)name(version(build))[key1='value 1',key2=value2]
```

where `()` indicate optional fields. `version` and `build` can be separated by a
space or `=` (see above). The rules for constructing a canonical string
representation are:

1. `name` (i.e. "package name") is required, but its value can be `*`. Its position is always
   outside the key-value brackets.
2. If `version` is an exact version, it goes outside the key-value brackets and is prepended
   by `==`. If `version` is a "fuzzy" value (e.g. `1.11.*`), it goes outside the key-value
   brackets with the `.*` left off and is prepended by `=`. Otherwise `version` is included
   inside key-value brackets.
3. If `version` is an exact version, and `build` is an exact value, `build` goes outside
   key-value brackets prepended by a `=`. Otherwise, `build` goes inside key-value brackets.
   `build_string` is an alias for `build`.
4. The `namespace` position is being held for a future conda feature.
5. If `channel` is included and is an exact value, a `::` separator is used between `channel`
   and `name`. `channel` can either be a canonical channel name or a channel url. In the
   canonical string representation, the canonical channel name will always be used.
6. If `channel` is an exact value and `subdir` is an exact value, `subdir` is appended to
   `channel` with a `/` separator. Otherwise, `subdir` is included in the key-value brackets.
7. The canonical format for key-value pairs uses comma delimiters and single quotes.
8. When constructing a `MatchSpec` queries instance from a string, any key-value pair given
   inside the key-value brackets overrides any matching parameter given outside the brackets.

### Matching conventions

#### String matching

Matching expressions that target string fields MUST be interpreted using these rules:

- If the expression begins with `^` and ends with `$`, it MUST be interpreted as a regular expression (regex). The expression matches if the regex search returns a hit; e.g. with Python: `re.search(expression, field) is not None`.
- If the expression contains an asterisk (`*`), it is considered a glob expression and MUST be interpreted as if it was a regular expression. To convert a glob expression into a regex string:
   1. Escape characters considered special in regex expressions adequately (e.g. using Python's `re.escape`).
   2. Replace escaped asterisks (`\*`) by `.*`.
   3. Wrap the resulting string with `^` and `$`.
- Otherwise, matches MUST be tested with exact, case-insensitive string equality.

#### Version matching

Expressions targeting the `version` field MUST be handled with additional rules. These expressions are referred to as _version specifiers_. A _version identifier_ will refer to versions strings as described in [CEP PR #132](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/132). For ordering-aware comparisons, the implied ordering is also described in [CEP PR #132](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/132).

A version specifier MUST consist of one or more _version clauses_, separated by logical operators that MUST follow these rules:

- `|` denotes the logical OR.
- `,` denotes the logical AND.
- `,` (AND) has higher precedence than `|` (OR).

A _version clause_ MUST follow one of these conventions:

- [String matching](#string-matching) rules, as defined in the section above. This applies to clauses expressed as exact version identifiers or version identifiers augmented with asterisks (`*`); e.g. `1.2.3`, `1.2.3.*`, and `1.*.3`.
- Exact equality, expressed as a version identifier prefixed by the double-equals string `==`, MUST be interpreted as a strict string equality test after removing the `==` prefix.
- Fuzzy equality, expressed as a version identifier prefixed by one `=` symbol. After removing the leading `=` character and appending a `.*` suffix, the string MUST be interpreted with [string matching](#string-matching) rules.
- Exclusion, expressed as a version identifier, or a version identifier augmented with asterisks, prefixed by the string `!=`, MUST be interpreted as a negated [string matching](#string-matching) test.
- Exclusive ordered comparison, expressed as a version identifier prefixed by `<` or `>`, MUST be interpreted as "smaller than" and "greater than", respectively, as per their position in the version ordering scheme.
- Inclusive ordered comparison, expressed as a version identifier prefixed by one of these strings: `<=`, `>=`, MUST be interpreted as in "exclusive ordered comparison", respectively, but they will also match if their position is equivalent in the version ordering scheme.
- Semver-like comparisons, expressed as a version identifier prefixed by the `~=` string, MUST be interpreted as greater or equals than the version identifier while also matching a fuzzy equality test for the version identifier sans its last segment (e.g. `~=0.5.3` expands to `>=0.5.3,0.5.*`). This operator is considered deprecated, and its expanded alternative SHOULD be used instead.

Version expressions SHOULD NOT contain spaces between operators, and MUST be removed and ignored if present.

### Version expression parsing

In the name of backwards compatibility, the (`name`, `version`, `build`) group in the `MatchSpec` [syntax][#syntax] allows two types of separators: spaces and a single `=` character. This conditions how certain `version` expressions are parsed. Given a _version identifier_ denoted as `version-identifier` (i.e. no operators or asterisks), the following rules MUST apply:

- If the string only contains two fields, which MUST be `name` and `version`:
  - `{name}={version-identifier}` and `{name} ={version-identifier}` (note the space) both denote fuzzy equality. They are equivalent to `{name}[version={version-identifier}.*]` and `{name} {version-identifier}.*`
  - `{name} {version-identifier}` denotes exact equality. It is equivalent to `{name}[version={version-identifier}]` and `{name}=={version-identifier}`.
- If the string contains three fields, `name`, `version` and `build`:
  - `{name} {version-identifier} {build}`, `{name} =={version-identifier} {build}`, `{name}={version-identifier}={build}` and `{name}=={version-identifier}={build}` all denote exact equality. They are equivalent to `{name}[version={version-identifier},build={build}]`.
  - `{name} ={version-identifier} {build}` denotes fuzzy equality.

Some examples for `name=pkg` and `version-identifier=1.8`, with equivalent version specifiers in the same paragraph:

```text
pkg=1.8
pkg =1.8
pkg 1.8.*
pkg 1.8.* *
pkg=1.8.*
pkg=1.8.*=*
pkg =1.8.* *
pkg[version=1.8.*]
pkg[version="1.8.*"]

pkg 1.8
pkg 1.8 *
pkg==1.8
pkg=1.8=*
pkg==1.8=*
pkg ==1.8 *
pkg[version=1.8]
pkg[version="1.8"]
```

### Fully specified expressions

To uniquely identify a single package record, a `MatchSpec` expression can be constructed in two ways:

- By passing exact values to the fields `channel` (preferably by URL), `subdir`, `name`, `version`, `build`.
- By matching its checksum directly: `*[md5=12345678901234567890123456789012]` or `*[sha256=f453db4ffe2271ec492a2913af4e61d4a6c118201f07de757df0eff769b65d2e]`.

## Examples

```python
>>> str(MatchSpec('foo 1.0 py27_0'))
'foo==1.0=py27_0'
>>> str(MatchSpec('foo=1.0=py27_0'))
'foo==1.0=py27_0'
>>> str(MatchSpec('conda-forge::foo[version=1.0.*]'))
'conda-forge::foo=1.0'
>>> str(MatchSpec('conda-forge/linux-64::foo>=1.0'))
"conda-forge/linux-64::foo[version='>=1.0']"
>>> str(MatchSpec('*/linux-64::foo>=1.0'))
"foo[subdir=linux-64,version='>=1.0']"
```

## Rationale

The initial `MatchSpec` form was a simpler `name [version [build]]` syntax (still in use in build recipes), with two optional keyword arguments (`optional`, `target`) between parentheses. The CLI also had its own string specification, which only supported name and version separated by `=` symbols (see [`conda 4.3.x`'s `spec_from_line()`](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/b65743878d9d368dc45dc0089a651e72adb10274/conda/cli/common.py#L517-L540)). `conda search` allowed queries based on regexes only.

With `conda 4.4.0`, a new syntax was introduced to unify and consolidate all these different variations (see [release notes for 4.4.0](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#new-feature-highlights-2), [`conda/conda#4158`](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/4158), and [`conda/conda#5517`](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/5517)), and also brought channel and subdir matching (fields before `::`) and arbitrary record field matching in between square brackets.

The new syntax had to maintain backwards compatibility with the space- and `=`-separated forms too. This is the reason behind some surprising behaviors discussed in the specification above.

Mixing `*` with other version-specific operators is disallowed as per the recommendations discussed in <https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/60>.
