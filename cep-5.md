## Abstract

conda-skeleton, the conda recipe generator, unfortunately is not well maintained. It is also deeply integrated with conda build itself. Grayskull, a community innovation, on the other hand is a stand alone conda recipe generator. Migrating away from conda-skeleton and adopting Grayskull as the de facto conda recipe generator would allow easy maintainence and faster generation of recipes.

## Specification

Grayskull presently supports the generation of recipes from PyPI and Python packages on GitHub. To make the migration from conda-skeleton to Grayskull, it is required to add more package origins to Grayskull. Adding R support to Grayskull is already a work in progress.
Below is a table comparing the various package repositories supported by conda-skeleton and Grayskull for recipe generation.

## Motivation

conda-skeleton is poorly maintained and is deep integrated with conda-build. This makes it harder to make changes and improvements to conda-skeleton without breaking something in conda-build itself. Grayskull is a community-developed conda recipe generator. It is a standalone tool and is a major improvement upon conda-skeleton.

  * Generates recipes faster than conda-skeleton (conda-skeleton generates Pytest recipe in 31 sec, whereas Grayskull generates it in 4 sec)
  * Detects noarch:python, conda-skeleton does not.
  * Detects compilers, conda-skeleton does not.

The Grayskull codebase is highly modular and hence easy to understand, follow and maintain.

## Backwards Compatibility

The proposed change will not break existing packages or workflows, since backwards compatibility will be maintained.
