## Abstract

[Conda]'s current default dependency solver based on [pycosat] has a number
of downsides that led to community efforts writing a faster and more
modern solver based on [libsolv]. The result was the basis for the
alternative conda implementation called [Mamba].

The intention of this CEP is to propose an experimental feature for
conda to add support for the solver used in [Mamba], eventually
based on the plugin architecture proposed in [CEP 2].

## Motivation

Conda's functionality and usability is predicated on the runtime
characteristics of its low-level dependency resolver since it's a
major part of its architecture -- next to the code infrastructure
for the command line interface, the environment management and
the handling of repo and channel data.

Speed, accuracy, debuggability and other impacts on the user
experience are heavily reliant on the underlying functionality of the
solver and conda's ability to interpret and communicate it to the user.
For example long running calls of the `conda install` command to resolve
complex environments and dependency trees directly impacts users'
real world experience of the package manager.

In addition, there is a wide-ranging proliferation of community efforts
to improve the usability issues with conda outside the regular conda
code project which makes it harder to retain a consistent technical
and community roadmap. As such the experimental integration of the Mamba
solver is to be considered but the first step to affect lasting change
in the conda community and recognize the innovative solutions that have
been worked on by community members.

## Specification

Conda contains a solver registry in the `conda.resolve` module, currently
(4.10.x) listing three solvers:

- [pycosat] (default), a wrapper around the [PicoSAT] solver
- [pycryptosat], a wrapper around the CryptoMiniSat solver
- [pysat], a generic wrapper for a number of SAT solvers, Glucose4 is used

These solvers expose a pure SAT interface: they are conda-agnostic and
only understand SAT clauses, generated by the `Clauses` classes.
`libsolv` and `mamba` do not expose a pure SAT interface, so adding
support for this solver requires modifications higher in the abstraction
tree.

`conda.core.solve` sits high up in the conda logic, right below the
command-line interface for the `install`, `update`, `remove` and
`create` commands. There, a class named `Solver` is in charge of
collecting the index metadata, prefix state and other variables before
sending the list of required `MatchSpec` objects to the underlying
`conda.resolve.Resolve` instance.

The `Resolve` class is too tied to the `Clauses` class, and some of its
abstractions do not hold true for `libsolv`. As a result, we need to
operate at the `Solver` level. We have to subclass `Solver` and replace its
`Solver.solve_final_state()` method, which only requires us to return an
iterable of `PackageRecord` objects that is then diffed with the initial
environment state and turned into a transaction by the other methods in
the base class.

The resulting subclass would live in a separate project
[conda-libmamba-solver] and only depends on `libmambapy` (Mamba's
Python wrapper) and `conda` itself. To enable the experimental solver,
we add a new key to the `Context` class (`experimental_solver`) and a
command-line flag (`--experimental-solver`), which can take any of the
values added to a new `Enum` in `conda.base.constants`
(`ExperimentalSolverChoice`). The adequate solver class would be
returned by a helper function added to `conda.core.solve`
(`_get_solver_class()`) once the `context` has been initialized.

> In a way, this means that the new solver class is _pre-registered_ as
> a plugin, but must be installed separately. In the future, when the
> plugin system described in CEP-2 is fully implemented, this manual
> integration could be replaced by the necessary plugin hooks.

The default choice for the solver class must stay the same as long
as the Mamba solver plugin is marked as experimental. Only after
considerable functional and integration testing to verify the performance
and solving improvements, it could be considered as a default candidate
-- and only in a new major version of conda.

The metrics that define the success of this experiment are to be determined
as part of the work on this CEP in coordination with the work on a
separate CEP for the minimum viable solving behavior and the related
test suite.

## Backwards Compatibility

Given the differences in implementations and algorithms between the
already supported solvers, it's to be expected that Mamba's solver will
also produce slightly different solutions, depending to the requested
set of dependencies.

To guarantee an acceptable degree of backwards compatibility with
`conda`'s behavior, we need to make the experimental solver
comply with the existing `conda` integration test suite.

Any potential backward incompatibilities discovered as part of this
work require formal documentation to be shared with the conda users
and also inform the decision making around the status as an experimental
solver.

In the future, the authors would like to see if it would be possible to
compile an essential technical specification and prose documentation of
the minimum viable solver logic, possibly accompanied by an automatic
test suite of expected outcomes. Given the intricate nuances and
implicit behavior of the existing logic, this task is deferred to a new
CEP, yet to be drafted.
