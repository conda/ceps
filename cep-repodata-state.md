## Abstract

Changing how conda and mamba store metadata about repodata.json downloads.

### Motivation

When conda currently downloads `repodata.json` files from the internet, it stores metadata "inside" the file by adding some JSON keys:

- `_url`: The URL that was requested
- `_etag`: ETag returned from server
- `_mod`: Last-Modified header from server
- `_cache_control`: Cache-Control header from server

These are stored as three string values.

This is not an ideal approach as it modifies the `repodata.json` file and corrupts e.g. the hash of the file. Also, the repodata files have gotten increasingly large, and parsing these state values can require parsing a large `json` file.

Therefore we propose to store the metadata in a secondary file called `<cache-key>.info.json` file next to the repodata.

Another motivating factor is that for the `jlap` proposal we need to (repeatedly) compute the hash value of the `repodata.json` file -- that only gives correct results straight away when the repodata is stored externally.

Both mamba and conda currently use the same cache folder. If both don't implement the same storage strategy but continue to share the same repodata cache, it would lead to frequent cache busting.

### Specification

```json5
{
    // we ensure that info.json and .json files are in sync by storing the file
    // last modified time in the info file, as well as the file size

    // seconds and nanoseconds counted from UNIX timestamp (1970-01-01)
    "mtime_ns": INTEGER,
    "size": INTEGER, // file size in bytes

    // most recent remote request e.g. "304 Not Modified", instead
    // of touching the cached repodata.json file.
    // compare with `cache_control: max-age=`.
    // nanosecond-resolution UNIX timestamp.
    "refresh_ns": INTEGER,

    // The header values as before
    "url": STRING,
    "etag": STRING,
    "mod": STRING,
    "cache_control": STRING,

    // Hash of the cached-on-disk repodata.json. In Python: hashlib.blake2b(digest_size=32)
    "blake2_256": STRING,
    // Upstream hash represented by the on-disk file. Used for jlap which
    // reformats the cached json but knows equivalent remote repodata.json hashes.
    "blake2_256_nominal": STRING,

    // these are alternative encodings of the repodata.json that
    // can be used for faster downloading
    // both `has_zst` and `has_jlap` keys are optional but should be kept
    // even if the other data times out or `file_mtime` does not match
    "has_zst": {
        // UTC RFC3999 timestamp of when we last checked wether the file is available or not
        // in this case the `repodata.json.zst` file
        // Note: same format as conda TUF spec
        // Python's time.time_ns() would be convenient?
        "last_checked": "2023-01-08T11:45:44Z",
        // false = unavailable, true = available
        "value": BOOLEAN
    },
    "has_jlap": {
        // same format as `has_zst`
    },

    "jlap": {
        // Intermediate checksum leading the second-to-last line of repodata.jlap
        "iv": "9448c699e681ee71b4bd524f73a0b690c387df7e9f0ea2bb7ffa24af1c8c27ca",
        // Offset of the start of the second-to-last line of repodata.jlap in bytes
        "pos": 4226360,
        // Last json line of repodata.jlap, before the trailing checksum
        "footer": {
            "url": "repodata.json",
            "latest": "3384620e0f2bf70a418a56db98785dda530b503990e32b68afb11f27e0324d7
    5"
        }
        // Other keys may appear e.g. for debugging
    }
}
```

If the `info.json` `mtime_ns` or `size` do not match the `.json` file the
header values are discarded. However, the `has_zst` or `has_jlap` values are kept as
they are independent from the repodata validity on disk.

If the client is tracking `repodata.json.zst` or `repodata.jlap` instead of
`(current_)?repodata.json`, then `etag`/`last_modified`/`cache_control` will correspond to
those remote files, instead of `repodata.json`.

## Locking

To ensure that the `info.json` is consistent with the cached `.json` even if
multiple programs are trying to update the cache at the same time, locking
should be used. The client uses the `info.json` file as a lock file. It holds an
advisory `fcntl()` or Windows record lock on byte 21 of that file while updating
both the `info.json` and `.json` files. It may or may not additionally lock the
`.json` file. If the lock fails, neither file is changed.

[A Python implementation](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/main/conda/gateways/repodata/lock.py)
[Mamba's LockFile class](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/blob/main/libmamba/include/mamba/core/util.hpp#L167)

This minimal scheme only helps to prevent the cache from being corrupted.
Additional locking would be neded to make it "advisable" to run multiple
installers in parallel.

### Backward compatibility

Older clients that try to reuse the existing cache will not be able to make use of the cached repodata as they do not know about the state (since it's not written to the same location). That means they will redownload the repodata.
