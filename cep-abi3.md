## Abstract

This CEP specifies how ABI3 python packages are supported in conda install tools
(conda/mamba/micromamba/pixi) and how they are built in conda build tools
(conda-build/rattler-build).

## Motivation

When building extensions for python, they might use python minor version
specific symbols. This results in the extension being usable only on that minor
version. These extensions are identified by the extension suffix.
For eg:

  foo.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

is an extension that support only CPython 3.10 on x86_64-linux-gnu platform.

However some symbols are available in all python major.minor versions with some
lower bound on the python version. These symbols are part of the
[limited C API]([C_API_Stability]). It is guaranteed that the symbols Stable ABI
introduced in Python 3.X are available in Python 3.Y for any `Y >= X`.
Extensions using only these symbols are identified by the extension suffix
`abi3.so`. For eg:

  foo.abi3.so

These extensions only support the platform it was built for (for eg:
`x86_64-linux-gnu`), but is not specified in the extension suffix.

Note that the stable ABI is only specific to CPython and is not compatible with
PyPy or other Python implementations. For a Python implementation independent
ABI, see the [HPy project](HPy).

The motivation for building abi3 packages is that we only need to build the
extension for one python version and the extension will work for any python
later version. This reduces build matrix from 4-5 python minor versions to one
python minor version and reduces the maintenance burden of package builders.

## noarch: python packages

abi3 packages are python version independent and we will first look at
`noarch: python` packages that are also python version independent and in addition
are arch independent.

`noarch: python` packages have several attributes to them:

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A1</strong>:
  They have `subdir: noarch` in `info/index.json`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A2</strong>:
  They have `noarch: python` in `info/index.json`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A3</strong>:
  Python files are in `<PREFIX>/site-packages`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A4</strong>:
  Entry points are recorded in `info/link.json`.

A conda install tool does four things to support them:

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B1</strong>:
  Files in `<PREFIX>/site-packages` are moved to the correct location. Eg:
  `<PREFIX>/lib/python3.10/site-packages`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B2</strong>:
  python files (files ending with `*.py`) are compiled to `.pyc` files. Eg:
  `<PREFIX>/lib/python3.10/site-packages/foo.py` is compiled to
  `<PREFIX>/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/foo.cpython-310.pyc`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B3</strong>:
  `.pyc` files created are recorded in `<PREFIX>/conda-meta/<pkg>.json`
  so that they are removed properly when the package is uninstalled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B4</strong>:
  Entry points in `info/link.json` are materialised.

### info/link.json file
An example `info/link.json` for `noarch: python` looks like

```json
{
  "noarch": {
    "entry_points": [
      "isympy = isympy:main"
    ],
    "type": "python"
  },
  "package_metadata_version": 1,
  "preferred_env": "foo"
}
```

An example for `info/link.json` for `noarch: generic` looks like
```
{
  "noarch": {
    "type": "generic"
  },
  "package_metadata_version": 1
}
```


Here `preferred_env` is ignored by conda since 2017 and is not supported by
other conda install tools. Therefore `info/link.json` is used exclusively
for `noarch` packages and out of the two types, `noarch: generic` packages
does not require any special action.

### info/index.json file

An example for a `noarch: python` recipe.

```json
{
  "arch": null,
  "build": "pyh2585a3b_103",
  "build_number": 103,
  "depends": [
    "mpmath >=0.19",
    "python >=3.8"
  ],
  "license": "BSD-3-Clause",
  "license_family": "BSD",
  "name": "sympy",
  "noarch": "python",
  "platform": null,
  "subdir": "noarch",
  "timestamp": 1718625708903,
  "version": "1.12.1"
}
```

### Current behaviour in solver tools

Conda package upload tools like `anaconda-client` use `A1` to upload
the package to the `noarch` subdir.

Conda install tools have slightly different behaviour.

Conda:
1. Actions `B1, B2, B3` are applied for packages with `A3`.
2. Action `B4` is applied for packages with `A4`.

Micromamba:
1. Actions `B1, B2, B3` are applied for packages with both `A2, A3`.
2. Action `B4` is applied for packages with both `A2, A4`.


## Implementation for abi3 packages in install tools.

In order to support abi3 packages, we propose two methods.

### `package_metadata_version = 1`

We require the following attributes in abi3 packages:

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C1</strong>:
  They have `subdir: <platform>` where `<platform>` is the subdir
  that the package was built for.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C2</strong>:
  They have `noarch: python`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C3</strong>:
  `A2, A3, A4` are applied.

This is compatible with `conda/mamba/micromamba` install tools
currently. This requires support from build tools to set `subdir: <platform>`
only.

In particular an option:
```
build:
  python_version_independent: true
```
to imply a python version independent package and set `noarch: python`
in `info/index.json`.

### `package_metadata_version = 2`

In this method, we require additional support from install tools.

For `abi3` and `noarch: python` pacakges, we record the `entry_points` and
the pure python files in `info/link,json`.

```json
{
  "python": {
    "entry_points": [
      "foo = foo:main"
    ],
    "py_compile": [
      "lib/python/site-packages/foo/main.py",
      "lib/python/site-packages/foo/__init__.py",
    ]
  },
  "package_metadata_version": 2,
}
```

We require the following support from install tools

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D1</strong>:
  Apply action `B4` if `python: entry_points` is present in `info/link.json`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D2</strong>:
  Apply actions `B2, B3` if `python: py_compile` is present in `info/link.json`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D3</strong>:
  Provide a `__supports_package_metadata_version=2` virtual package.

Note that we do not require `B1` as package authors should depend on a python
version that has a custom `site.py` that adds `lib/python/site-packages` to
the path.

We require additional support from build tools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E1</strong>:
  Move contents in `<SP_DIR>` to `<PREFIX>/lib/python/site-packages`
  instead of `<PREFIX>/site-packages`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E2</strong>:
  Record pure python `.py` files to be compiled in `info/link.json`.
  TODO: not sure if this is required. We can infer this from `info/index.json`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E3</strong>:
  For `noarch: generic` packages, we do not require `info/link.json` file and
  build tools are recommended to not produce a `info/link.json` file.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E4</strong>:
  Adds a `__supports_package_metadata_version>=2` in `run`.

## Alternatives considered

### Apply all actions in a `post-link.sh` script.

A draft work provided at [python-feedstock](python-pr-669)
This was suggested by `@mbargull`, but some community members (@baszalmstra,
@wolfv) does not prefer post-link scripts as they can be used for arbitrary
code execution. However in the author's opinion, this attack vector is not a
new one since the install tool uses the python executable in the host
environment to compile the python files.

### `noarch: python` packages with `__linux, __osx, __win` constrains.

This suggestion by `@wolfv` is not ideal as this clutters `noarch` subdir
`repodata.json` file with packages that are useless for the platform in question.
