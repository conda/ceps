## Abstract

As the conda ecosystem is being standardized and evolving, the existing standards 
(in many cases only documented by the code that implements them) have been called 
`v1` in some cases (e.g., `.tar.bz2` versus `.conda`) and `v0` in others (e.g., `v0` versus `v1` recipe formats). 
This differing nomenclature is confusing. In this CEP, we resolve this issue by declaring all existing `conda` 
standards, documented formally in CEPs or not, the `v0` standards.

## Specification

All existing conda standards which satisfy the following conditions

- are documented formally in CEPs or are only effectively documented through code implementations
- have not been superceeded by a newer standard labeled `v1`

MUST be versioned at `v0`. 

The number of conda package formats, `.tar.bz2` and `.conda`, is exempt from this CEP.

## Backwards Compatibility

The `v0` versioning is fully backwards compatible with all current standards, except conda package formats
which have been explicitly excluded.
