## Abstract

This CEP standardizes the archive file formats used for conda artifacts distribution: `.tar.bz2` and `.conda`.

## Motivation

The motivation of this CEP is merely informative. It describes the details existing archive file formats.

## Nomenclature

- Archive: A compressed file which, once extracted, may result in one or more files and/or directories.
- Artifact: The distributable file that is produced as a result of a build process. It happens to be an archive. When used as "conda artifact", it is meant to encompass both `.tar.bz2` and `.conda` archive file formats.
- Tarball: A file that has been produced by running `tar` on a set of files. The resulting `.tar` file MAY be further compressed into another file format (e.g. `.gz` or `.bz2`), and may be still called compressed tarball or simply tarball.
- Package: Roughly speaking, a distributable artifact that ships executable, libraries or resources needed to support the execution of programs. It may refer to the compressed archive, or its extracted form, without further distinction. The emphasis is on the distributed contents, not so much on the form.

## Specification

conda packages, whose contents are described and standardized in [CEP PR#133](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/133), MAY be archived and distributed in two formats:

- `.tar.bz2`: The first generation of conda archives. Referred to as version 1.
- `.conda`: The second generation of conda archives. Referred to as version 2.

### `.tar.bz2`

To produce a `.tar.bz2` file, the conda package directory as described in [CEP PR#133](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/133) MUST be first archived into an uncompressed tarball (`.tar`). The root level of the archive MUST match the root level of the target location once installed (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories). The resulting tarball MUST be then compressed using the BZ2 compression scheme. The filename MUST follow [CEP 26](./cep-0026.md), with a `.tar.bz2` extension. Namely: `{name}-{version}-{build}.tar.bz2`.

For example, given a package directory `project-1.2.3-0/`, GNU `tar` can be used like this:

```bash
cd project-1.2.3-0/
tar cvjf project-1.2.3-0.tar.bz2 .
```

The resulting tarball `project-1.2.3-0.tar.bz2` can be extracted using:

```bash
tar xvf project-1.2.3-0.tar.bz2
```

### `.conda`

A `.conda` artifact MUST be a ZIP file whose filename follow [CEP 26](./cep-0026.md) with a `.conda` extension (i.e. `{name}-{version}-{build}.conda`) and ships two inner compressed tarballs and a JSON document:

- `info-{name}-{version}-{build}.tar.{extension}`
- `pkg-{name}-{version}-{build}.tar.{extension}`
- `metadata.json`

The `info-*` and `pkg-*` tarballs MUST be compressed using any compression scheme, but SHOULD use ZSTD (with `extension = '.zst'`) for better results. Each tarball MUST be named with the above syntax, taking the `name`, `version` and `build` values from the `info/index.json` file as described in [CEP PR#133](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/133).

The `info-*` tarball MUST contain the full `info/` folder as described in [CEP PR#133](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/133). The `pkg-*` tarball MUST carry everything else in the package directory. The root level of the tarballs MUST match the root level of the target location once installed (i.e. no intermediate subdirectories).

The `metadata.json` MUST be a JSON document that ships a dictionary following this schema:

- `conda_pkg_format_version: int`. The version of the `.conda` format. Currently `2`.

For example, given a package directory `project-1.2.3-0/`, GNU `tar` and `zstd` can be used like this:

```bash
mkdir workspace/
cd project-1.2.3-0/
tar --use-compress-program=zstd cvf info-project-1.2.3-0.tar.zstd info/
mv info-project-1.2.3-0.tar.zstd ../workspace
tar --use-compress-program=zstd cvf pkg-project-1.2.3-0.tar.zstd !info/
mv pkg-project-1.2.3-0.tar.zstd ../workspace
cd ../workspace
touch '{"conda_pkg_format_version": 2}' > metadata.json
zip project-1.2.3-0.conda .
```

The resulting `project-1.2.3-0.conda` archive can be extracted with:

```bash
unzip project-1.2.3-0.conda
tar --use-compress-program=zstd xvf info-project-1.2.3-0.tar.zstd
tar --use-compress-program=zstd xvf pkg-project-1.2.3-0.tar.zstd
```

## Rationale

`.conda` was introduced as a replacement for `.tar.bz2` for the following reasons:

- Uncompressing `.tar.bz2` tarballs is very slow compared to other modern solutions, which tend to be between 4 and 10 times faster.
- BZ2 is not at the cutting edge of compression in terms of ratio. By utilizing modern compression algorithms, artifacts can get as 60% smaller than the equivalent .tar.bz2 file.
- It relies on `unbzip2` being installed on the system. Sometimes it is not (e.g. Docker images).
- Metadata reading from packages currently requires complete extraction of a `.tar.bz2` file. This prevents tools from indexing and performing other metadata tasks much more quickly if the `info/` folder was more accessible.
- Package signing currently would require signing either all files in a package, or having a sidecar signature file shipped alongside `.tar.bz2` files.  It is desirable to ship a signature within a package, but to have that signature apply to an archive within the package.

The two layer strategy was inspired by the [Debian (`.deb`) package format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)).

The outer format should be:

- extractable, using standard tools that are present on every platform
- indexable, so that subsections of the file can be accessed and extracted quickly
- uncompressed, because the inner containers handle the compression of any real data

Zip files were chosen because they are the most ubiquitous format that matches all of these criteria.

The inner format should be a compressed tarball using efficient and performant compression schemes. The most fitting format for that description is ZSTD with `.tar.zstd`.
