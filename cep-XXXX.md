## Abstract

As the conda ecosystem is being standardized and evolving, the existing standards
(in many cases only documented by the code that implements them) have been called
`v1` in some cases (e.g., `.tar.bz2` versus `.conda`) and `v0` in others (e.g., `v0` versus `v1` recipe formats).
This differing nomenclature is confusing. In this CEP, we resolve this issue by declaring all existing `conda`
standards, documented formally in CEPs or not, the `v1` standards.

## Specification

All existing conda standards which satisfy the following conditions

- are documented formally in CEPs or are only effectively documented through code implementations
- have not been superseded by a newer standard labeled `v1`

MUST be versioned at `v1`.

The numbering of build recipe formats is exempt from this CEP.

Standards MUST use a version specifier that consists only of numbers and `.`s, has a major version,
and has at most a minor version (i.e. matches the regex `^[0-9]+($|\.[0-9]+$)`). A `v` MAY be prepended
for clarity, but MUST be removed before comparing versions. Version comparisons and ordering MUST follow
`conda`'s version comparison and ordering conventions.

## Backwards Compatibility

The `v1` versioning is fully backwards compatible with all current standards, except recipe formats
which have been explicitly excluded.
